# Todo-List

# User Story:

AS A user I want to be able to write down a list of todos so that i can keep track of what I do on a daily basis.

# Application
This is a simple todo application. It includes the features to add, delete and check of tasks put in the list. This is very handy for somebody that has a lot of things that need to be done.

# Outcome

This was supposed to be a simple application. There was going to be nothing complex. After watching a few tutorials I decided to expand a little bit. It did come with problems. I did have trouble with implementing some of the features. This took me a while to finish but it is done.
